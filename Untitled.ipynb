    "1.\tProblems Encountered in the Map\n",
    "The main problems encountered in the map are:\n",
    "-\tInconsistent house numbers\n",
    "-\tInconsistent phone numbers\n",
    "Inconsistent house numbers.\n",
    "\tThe house numbers can sometimes have letters in it, e.g. 11a.\n",
    "\tAlso, if a house has several buildings, the building type and number or letter is added.\n",
    "\tThe building type can be “корпус” (corpus) or “строение” (stroyenie), depending on whether or not it has a separate entry from the street, and it can also be a “владение” (vladeniye), if it is a custom-built structure or even not a building (e.g. construction site).\n",
    "\tIn some cases, a house can have multiple building types and numbers: “14 к2с1” \n",
    "\tIf a house stands on street intersection, it gets numbers from both streets, divided by a slash symbol, e.g. 5/16.\n",
    "\tIf a house was built in place of several demolished houses, its number is a range with a dash symbol: 7-11.\n",
    "\tEverything above is only valid for Moscow, and in other cities houses are numbered differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistent phone numbers.\n",
    "\tThe phone numbers can have various formats, for example: +7 495 1234567, +7-495-123-45-67, +7(495)123-45-67. \n",
    "\tThe external code of Russia (+7), can be substituted for 8, the internal code for calling outside your phone zone.\n",
    "\tObjects can have several phone numbers, separated by either a dot or semicolon.\n",
